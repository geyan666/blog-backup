### Are you alive?

You can't connect the dots looking forward,  
you can only connect them looking backwards.  
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.  
``` bash
你很难把你生命中已经经历的点点滴滴串联起来形成一个牛逼点子，
你只有可能把他们和你未来将要经历的连起来。
所以，请坚信美好的事物即将发生。
```
You have to trust in something,  
your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.  
Because believing that the dots will connect down the road  
will give you the confidence to follow your heart,  
even when it leads you off the well worn path.  
And that will make all the difference.  
``` bash
心怀信仰，
无论是勇气，命运，甚至姻缘。
只有心怀信仰，你才会满怀信心听从内心的召唤，一路向前，
披荆斩棘。
所有这些，都将成就不一样的你。
```
Your time is limited,  
so don't waste it living someone else's life.  
Don't be trapped by dogma,  
which is living with the results of other people's thinking.  
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.  
You've to find what you love.  
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.  
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,  
and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work,  
and the only way to do great work is to love what you do.  
If you haven't found it yet,  
keep looking, and don't settle.  
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.  
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.  
``` bash
生命短暂，
不要复制别人的生活来浪费它。
挣脱教条，
因为那是别人所思所想之概念。
千万不要让别人的口水封死你内心深处的呼唤。
你必须必须必须找到你的挚爱，
工作如此，爱人也如此。
生命一大半都在工作，
只有做你心目中最伟大的工作才会使你真正意义上的满意，
而能做你心目中最伟大的工作的方式就是做你喜欢做的事情。
如果你还未找到，
继续找，不要停。
勇敢地跟着内心走，
它在某种程度上知道你想要成为什么。
```
You're going to have some ups and you're going to have some downs.  
Most people give up on themselves easily.  
You know the human spirit is powerful?  
There is nothing as powerful -- it's hard to kill the human spirit!  
Anybody can feel good when they have their health, their bills are paid, they have happy relationships.  
Anybody can be positive then.  
Anybody can have a large vision then.  
Anybody can have faith under those kinds of circumstances.  
The real challenge of growth, mentally, emotionally and spiritually comes when you get knocked down.  
It takes courage to act.  
Part of being hungry when you've been defeated, it takes courage...to start over again.  
``` bash
在追求内心的道路上你将有得有失，
很多人轻易放弃了自己。
你知道吗？精神是强大的！
其实没啥强大之说 -- 精神是永存的！
健康，富有，权利，
坐拥这些，任何人都会喜笑颜开，精神满满，境界高升。
当你跌倒时，成长的挑战来自于心理、情绪和精神。
做出行动需要勇气，
当你被击败时，苟延残喘，
你需要勇气！从头开始！
```
Fear kills dreams.  
Fear kills hope.  
Fear put people in the hospital.  
Fear can age you,  
can hold you back from doing something that you know within yourself that you are capable of doing,  
but it will paralyze you.  
``` bash
恐惧可以扼杀你的梦想，
恐惧可以扼杀你的希望，
恐惧可以剥夺你的健康，
恐惧可以衰减你的寿命，
恐惧可以阻止你做你其实知道你能做到的事，
恐惧废掉了你！
```
At the end of your feelings is nothing,  
but at the end of every principle is a promise.  
Behind your feelings, it might not be absolutely nothing at the end of your little feelings.  
But behind every principle is a promise.  
As some of you in your life,  
the reason why you are not at your goal right now...because you just all about your feelings.  
You are all on your feelings.  
You don't feel like waking up.  
So who does?  
Everyday, you say 'no' to your dreams,  
you might be pushing your dreams back a whole six month, a whole year!  
That one single day,  
that one day you didn't get up could have push your stuff back I don't know how long.  
``` bash
情绪宣泄，一事无成；
严于律己，一诺千金。
好吧，小情绪可能带来些许改变，
但是每个原则都蕴藏这一个承诺，掷地有声。
你之前的过往中为什么老是踟蹰不前？
因为你只照顾你自己的小情绪！
你太情绪化了！
你不想觉醒！
谁他妈能叫醒你啊？！
日复一日，
你无视你的梦想，
你可能把你今天的梦想一脚踢到了半年之后！一年之后！
呵呵，有那么一天，
你又赖床，
我他妈不知道你把你的梦想遗弃到了什么鬼地方！
```
Don't allow your emotion to control you.  
We are emotional.  
But we wanna begin to discipline your emotion.  
If you don't discipline and contain your emotion, they will use you.  
``` bash
不要当你情绪的奴隶。
我们虽然是性情中人，
但是我们要学会控制自己的情绪，
不然，
我们真的会被奴役！
```
You want it.  
And you are going to go all out to have it.  
It's not to be going easy, when you want to change.  
It's not easy.  
If it were in fact easy, everyone could do it.  
But if you are serious, you will go all out!  
``` bash
你想奋斗哈？
你想全力以赴去争取哈？
当你想要改变，一切都不会太简单！
真的！
如果它真的简单，别人早做了！
但是如果你认真，你不可限量！
```
I am in control here.  
I'm not going to let this get me down.  
I'm not going to let this destroy me.  
I'm coming back.  
And I'll be stronger and better because of it.  
``` bash
我是主宰。
我不会气馁。
我不会被摧毁。
王者归来。
我会变得更好更强。
```
You have got to make a declaration...  
That this is what you stand for!  
You are standing up for your dream.  
You are standing up for a piece of mind.  
You are standing up for health.  
Take full responsibility for your life.  
Accept where you are and the responsibility that you are going to take yourself where you want to go.  
You can decide that I'm going to live each day as if it were my last!  
``` bash
君子一言，驷马难追 --
这才是你应该的姿态！
你就是你的梦想本身，
你就是你自己的内心，
你就是你自己的身躯。
为你自己负全责吧！
接受现在的你，
承担起你实现理想的责任。
你能把你每一天过得像世界末日一样精彩！
```
Live your life with passion!  
With some drive.  
Decide that you are going to push yourself.  
The last chapter to your life has not been written yet,  
and it doesn't matter about what happened yesterday,  
it doesn't matter what happened to you,  
what matters is:  
What Are You Going To Do About It?!  
``` bash
激情满满，
动力十足，
你将随时发动自己。
生命的尾声还未书写，
昨天往事亦不必追忆，
无论何事无故加之于身，
重要的是：
你想怎么做？
```
This year I will make this goal become a reality.  
I won't talk about it anymore.  
I can! I can! I can!!!  
``` bash
今年，我将实现这个目标。
至此，我不再会叨逼叨。
我相信！我能！
```
To persevere I think is important for everybody.  
Don't give up.  
Don't give in.  
There is always an answer to everything.  
``` bash
坚持，世人皆如此。
别放弃。
别退却。
善因必将有善果。
```
有什么东西能阻止去追求你真正想要的？  
如果你真的是认真的，  
就回到真的自己，  
去堵上一切，  
放手一搏！  

你会发现那个  
真的  
牛逼的  
最珍贵的  
自己。  

（遇到挫折时，记得回来看看视频）
