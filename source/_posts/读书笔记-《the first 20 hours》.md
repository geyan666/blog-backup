最近看了很多博客，一来看看大牛们都是怎么记录自己的生活和感悟的，二来看看有什么美到叹息的UI设计以供我来参考，偶然看到一个视频（戳此看：[the first 20 hours](https://first20hours.com "网页内的视频")），网络就是这么神奇，总能看到令人震撼的东西。

如你所见，这是一本教人快速解构一项技能的复杂度并加之以刻意练习，学会你所想get到的技能或曾经丢掉的兴趣。说到刻意练习，你应该听说过一万小时定律，不过有没有可能在20小时内办得到呢？

多看书，多动手，一切都不迟。

### A Note to the Reader

The First 20 Hours is a book about rapid skill acquisition: how to pick up new skills as fast as humanly possible. You can go from knowing absolutely nothing to performing noticeably well in a very short period of time: approximately 20 hours, often less.

## A Portrait of the Author as a Learning Junkie

So much to do... and so little time. The story of modern life. Does it really take 10,000 hours to become good at something? What "rapid skill acquisition" really is, and how it works.

## 10 Principle of Rapid Skill Acquisition

- Lovable project
- One skill at a time
- Target performance level
- Deconstruction
- Critical tools
- Barriers to practice
- Make time
- Fast feedback loops
- Short bursts
- Quality and speed

## 10 Principle of Effective Learning

- Research, but not to much
- Jump in
- Mental models and hooks
- Imagine the opposite
- Talk to practitioners
- Eliminate distractions
- Spaced repetition
- Scaffolds and checklists
- Predictions and tests
- Honor your biology

## Programming

## Touch Typing

## Go

## Ukulele

- Isolate, practice, repeat
- Set an audacious goal
- The critical few
- Chords and strumming patterns
- Make it automatic
- Showtime

### Summary: How I learned to Play the Ukulele

- I obtained a ukulele, strings, a tuner, and other necessary equipment.
- I decided to begin by focusing on learning the most common chord progressions and strumming patterns, which allowed me to play thousands of popular songs.
- Once I was able to play chords and strum without looking at the fretboard or strings, I practiced until I could maintain the pattern and change chords without thinking about it.
- When I was comfortable with basic chords and strumming patterns, I began learning songs by humming along as I played, learning where the words and chord changes overlapped, then adding lyrics until I could sing and play at the same time.
- I experimented with fingerpicking the same chord progression instead of strumming, which let me play sounds that sounded more complex.
- I learned the I, IV, V chord progression, which helped me figure out how to play even more songs.

### What's the difference between a guitar and an Ukulele

The most common ukulele tuning for a soprano, concert, or tenor ukulele is GCEA. These strings are a 5th higher than the four highest strings of the standard guitar tuning of the EADGBE. If you put a capo (a bar that bars an entire fret) on the 5th fret of a guitar, then playing using the four highest strings, you're essentially playing an ukulele -  the only difference is that the G string (on pun instead) is one octave higher on the ukulele than it is on the guitar, given the ukulele's "reentrant" tuning.

In fact, baritone ukuleles are toned DGBE, the same as the four highest strings of the guitar. From that perspective, guitars are simply 6 string baritone ukuleles. Now you know!

### The Next Chanllenge: Looping

Some musicians enjoy simulating the layered production effect using a "looper", which samples audio for a few seconds, then replays it through an amplifier. The loops are controlled by a foot pedal, so the musician has their hands free to play. By creating multiple loops, the musician can produce full songs, effectively becoming a one-man band.
