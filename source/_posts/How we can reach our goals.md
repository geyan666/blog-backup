## Day-1

### And by "willpower",I mean some innate quality of inner strength that allows those who have it to successfully avoid temptation.

``` bash
[v]allow

[v]avoid

```

<!--more-->

### Most people believe that it's fundamentally a character issue.Some people have willpower(the thin,nonsmokers --- and we admire them for it).Others don't,and we judge them accordingly.

``` bash

[v]admire
[v]judge
```

### Willpower is not what you think it is.

``` bash

### But he isn't --- he is the mixed-race child of a broken home and a family of average means,with no particular advantages other than his clearly extraordinary intelligence and determination.

``` bash

## Day-2

### When you tax it too much,the well of self-control will certainly run dry.

[v]develop

### Succeed is about understanding how goals work,what tends to go wrong,and what you can do to reach your goals ro to help others reach theirs.

### Setting specific,challengling goals creates a cycle of success and happiness that can repeat itself over and over again,creating the "high performance cycle".

``` bash

[adj]abstract

## Day-6

### In studies of optimistic beliefs,psychologists routinely find that most of us believe we are much more likely than our peers to "have good things happen to us --- to have successful careers,own our homes,make a lot of money,and live past ninety".

``` bash
[n]belief
[n]peer

[n]potential
[n]process
```

### Your beliefs about your strengths and your weaknesses play a large role in determining the goals you set for yourself.

```bash
[n]strength
[n]weakness
[v]play a large role
```

### If you believe that smartness is something you are more or less born with,something that is largely genetic,or something that develops in childhood but then is pretty much constant through adulthood,then you are an entity theorist when it comes to your intelligence.

```bash
[n]smartness
[adj]genetic
[adj]constant
```

### If you believe that smartness is a quality that is developed over time through experience and learning,and that people can get more of it if they apply themselves,then you are an incremental theorist.

```

### Entity theorists make choices and set goals designed specifically to validate their intelligence.

### You can believe that your personality is fixed --- that you are who you are and you can't teach an old dog new tricks.Or you can believe it is malleable --- that you can change and improve your personality and turn over a new leaf.

```bash
[n]personality
[adj]fixed
[adj]malleable

## Day-8

### When we believe that there is something about ourselves we can not change,we pursue goals that focus exclusively on presenting ourselves to others in the best possible light.

```

### Smart parents give their children a lot more than just a bunch of chromosomes.Smart parents seem to give their children many,many more chances to develop their intelligence.

```bash
[n]chromosome
[n]chance
```

### Smart parents create home environments that are richer in learning opportunities.They talk more to their children.Often,they make more money and so are better able to provide educational opportunities and send their children to better school districts.

```bash
[n]learning opportunity
[v]provide
[n]school district
```

### The key to getting smarter is first coming to believe that it is possible to get smarter --- our beliefs can open(or close)that door.

### The degree of heritability of IQ places no constraint on the degree of modifiability that is possible.

```bash
[n]heritability
[n]constraint
[n]modifiability
```

### Intelligence is profoundly malleable --- experience matters a lot.

```bash

```

### The vast majority of goals you are pursuing everyday of your life operate entirely without your awareness.

```bash

[v]operate
[n]awareness
```

### The more we do something,the more automatic it becomes --- the more it is controlled by our unconscious thoughts.

```bash
[adj]automatic

```

### A consciously,intentionally chosen goal can give you the same results as a completely unconsciously triggered goal.

```bash
[adj]chosen
[adj]triggered
```

## Day-9

### Performance goals are characterized by an all-or-nothing quality --- you either reach the goal or you don't.When all you care about is being good,being almost good or mostly good is really not much consolation.

```bash
[n]performance
[v]characterize
an all-or-nothing quality 孤注一掷
[n]consolation
```

### But Performance goals have a double-edged-sword quality --- those ties to self-worth that make them so motivating are also what make them less adaptive when the going gets tougher.

```bash
a double-edged-sword quality 双刃剑
[n]tie
[n]self-worth
[adj]adaptive
```

### Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.

```bash
[n]failure
[v]realize
[adj]close
```

### A mastery goal is less about any one performance and more performance over time.There goals are tied to self-worth in a totally different way,because they are about self-improvement rather than self-validation.

```bash
over time
[v]be tied to
[n]self-improvement
rather than 而不是
[n]self-validation
```

### When people run into trouble in pursuit of get-better goals,they don't get depressed and helpless like the be-gooders --- they take action.They ask themselves what they are doing wrong,and they fix it.

```bash
[v]run into
[adj]depressed
[adj]helpless
[v]fix
```

### People who are focus on trying to develop a skill are not that impressed by rewards.But when you are trying to demonstrate what you can do,it's that much more motivating when high ability earns you something you really want.

```bash
[v]impress
[v]demonstrate
[v]earn
```

### A very different picture emerges,however,when the road gets rockier --- when people are dealing with unfamiliar,complex,or difficult tasks,with obstacles,or with setbacks.That's where the advantages of focusing on growth over glory become clear.

```bash
[v]emerge
[adj]complex
[n]setback
[n]glory
```

### When you are focused on getting better,rather than on being good,you benefit in two very important ways.First,when things get tough --- when you are faced with complexity,time presure,obstacles,or unexpected challenges --- you don't get so discouraged.

```bash
[v]benefit
[adj]tough
[n]complexity
[adj]unexpected
[adj]discouraged
```
### When a task is difficult,and persistence is the key to higher achievement,get-better mastery goals have the clear advantages.

``` bash
[n]persistence
[n]mastery
[n]advantage
```

## Day-10

### When persistence is what is needed to Succeed --- when you need to be in it for the long haul and not give up too soon --- get-better goals are just what the doctors ordered.

```bash
[n]haul
[v]order
```

###
Be-good goals are all about the outcome,and so that's what holds all of our attention.Getter-better goals,on the other hand,are all about the journey.

```bash
[n]outcome
[v]hold
[n]journey
```

### When people pursue get-better goals,they find greater interest and enjoyment in what they do.They have a heightened attention to the process,experience a greater sense of involvement and immersion,and personally value what they are learning more.

```bash
[n]enjoyment
[adj]heightened
[n]involvement
[n]immersion
[v]value
```

### One of the most important things you can do to reach any difficult goal is know when to ask for and accept help.Seeking help can be a very effective way to cope with obstacles,face challenges,or just navigate unfamiliar terrain.

```bash
[v]accept
[v]seek
[v]cope with
[v]navigate
[n]terrain
```

### For people who focus on growth and progress,as opposed to constantly trying to prove themselves,the depressions that to occur tend to be both less severe and less frequent.

```bash
[v]prove
[v]occur
[adj]severe
[adj]frequent
```

### The more depressed getting-better people get,the more likely they are to keep up with their other goals --- the sadder they felt,the quicker they were tackle the laundry pile and crack those books.

```bash
[v]keep up with
[v]crack
```

### Failures become feedback on how to improve.Obstacles become surmountable.Feeling bad propels you off the couch.Change your goal and you change your glasses --- your world becomes a very different place.

```bash
[n]feedback
[adj]surmountable
[v]propel
```
